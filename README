LebAdvisor 
----------
Working on continuous integration and continuous deployment

keep the master branch clean : no data no settings and ready for deployment

on main page make the data from the default of offers / the first one
make maximum hours of period is 24
make newly created booking displayable on the frontend
make package and tour booking stock reduce from the confrimation
change from activity to activity offer in the frontend
do not serialize what doesn't need to be serialized send raw numbers and corrupted data instead
stock and unit can be removed now from the main activity/tour/package

multiple types of units , multiple price and a ratio of unit / stock.

if youre not logged in and tried to book you should be redirected to login form

supplier should be able to edit the offer -- later 
booking page tours not displaying pictures 
margin bottom
on booking activity it takes you to the main page but when booking tour it takes you to the booking 
page

- make advanced iternary design with information about what to do in each place and icons for 
common things
- refactoring file by file and take notes

-display is fine i think , add some data to the card
- refresh page after booking so notifications show



- for you is not working on init
- when any notiifcation is clicked it redirects to the booking / dashboard page
- make the user session available for 15 days
- send notiifcations on confirm payment for supplier and customer
- qr code to include the host name in Tours and Packages
- remove confirm payment button(replaced by qr code)
- do not display offers that their time has passed
- display cost per stock in the booking form
- booking card display quanity with unit and total price (instead of item price)
- remove for you from the main page for guests
- fix: items only showing for loggedin users (in the main page)
- fix: for you items not showing (no request is sent) after fresh login from different account
- enforce strong password validation during registration

- ithinkthereisaproblem in the package booking that needs to be solved read bookings/views
- connect to external services (sms and location)
- make a cool iternary with all the stuff that we will do in this trip from the beginning 
to the end. this should be some kind of guide for the user to choose if they'll like the 
trip and to know what is included and what is not

- what after we update email and password, make a sign that things worked
- fix: need to refresh after login (this can wait)
- add ability to change email user and password

there 's no guest booking on the platfrom  -- easy profile create no need for guest booking

make the booking save the number of stock you are booking and the price of the booking 
especially if your booking offer has multiple offers

fix models. before testing
creating account and login 
--------------------------
you should be able to give preferences, location
get locations and categories and make the user choose from them 
by default all are selected

make the categories and location in a dropdown section
